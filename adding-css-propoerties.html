<p> jQuery is the “Write Less, Do More” JavaScript library. It is not a programming language, but rather a tool used to make writing common JavaScript tasks more concise. jQuery has the added benefit of being cross-browser compatible, meaning you can be certain the output of your code will render as intended in any modern browser. </p>
